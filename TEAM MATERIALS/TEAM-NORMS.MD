# NORMS

## What does this group do when two or more members disagree?

If it's something light -- rock paper scissors. If it's a major issue, defer to Sabrina.

## What does this group do when a member is frustrated?

Have an open line of communication, ego out the door. Address things before it gets to a point of frustration. Communicate about things re: both project & life so we're all on the same page.

## What does this group do when we merge our work together?

When anyone is ready to merge, we ALL look at the work together. Regular check-ins regarding progress.

## When does this group ask for help?

If someone's struggling with something we can defer to the whole group and try to figure it out together. If we can't figure it out as a team, THEN ask for help.

## How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?

Regular team norms apply to pairs. Up to pairs to decide of timing based on what it is they are working on.

## How does this group approach work "after hours" (after normal class hours and weekends)?

We're all definitely going to be working after hours, but we will keep our meetings and check-ins during class time unless people are around to have convos about stuff after.

## What time does this group have daily standup?

Right after REACTO meetings, another check in at 5:30 before EOD
